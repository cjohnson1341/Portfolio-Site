		<p>I worked with the product team on wireframes and design iterations for our squad and social UI, a core pillar of Out of Time's user experience. UI wireframes/designs were done by me in Figma, then formatted and imported for Unreal. UMG widgets that leveraged Common UI for controller support were used to create all the designs in Unreal; I also contributed to the engineering implementation in blueprints. The player tiles specifically had to be created in a modular way so they could be used in both squad and social panel experiences.

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>While initially researching for this project, we looked at social and MMO type games like Fortnite, Warframe and New World to inform our information hierarchy and layout ideas.
			<ul class="list">
			<li>• A tile-based approach seemed best since we would want to expand user actions and also use these tiles in a few places, like the squad panel.</li>
			<li>• Tiles offered a quick way to discern if users were online or offline, if they were friends, and where they might be at any given moment.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Social Panel Iterations</h2>
		<p>Since our game relied heavily on co-op play, the social and squad panels had to do a lot of heavy lifting when it came to user experience while also being their own distinct screens. When looking at the social panel, it had to enable users to easily parse and take action on a few things:</p>
        <ul class="list">
			<li>• Most importantly and located at the top of the list: Who wants to be your friend? And who is already your friend?</li>
			<li>• Next on the list, we wanted to be sure you could see immediately who was nearby and available to do a run.</li>
            <li>• Lastly, we wanted you to have a list of available players that you had recently played with. Since our queuing system could pop you into a run with anyone, we wanted you to be able to see who it was that did 12k damage as a tank/healer in that last run!</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Squad Panel Iterations</h2>
		<p>The squad panel was a conundrum of "how much of the screen should we cover?" While the social panel was intended as a companion screen that you could have open while looking into the world, we felt the squad panel was a much more purposeful action taken by the player and should both represent your squaded state AND show you a social list of players you could specifically take squad actions on. We had so many conversations about whether or not it would negatively impact the user experience if the player couldn't see what was going on behind the screen, but in the end we did decide to do a full screen design. This enabled us to have a left hand "squad state" UI that could show up whether the panel was open or closed, as well as a specific "squad social panel" that would only show when you needed to form a squad or take specific squad actions.</p>

		<h2>Final Implementation</h2>
		<p>Both the squad and social panel UMG components were built by me, and then then I went in and helped hook up data, viewmodels, and animations with a UI Engineer. It was one of the more complex UIs I've ever built and it really was quite satisfying to see it all come together at the end. </p>
