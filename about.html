  				<h2>Hello.</h2>
  				<p>I'm someone who would go to school forever if not for the crippling weight of student loans. As it is, the internet is a great plan B. I got into design and development as a way to bring my creations to life, and so far, none of them have tried to attack the nearest village. I count that as a win. </p>
  				<p>I'm passionate about creating things that not only look beautiful, but <strong>work</strong> beautifully too. It's always disappointing to see something absolutely stunning, only to find out you can't figure out where the exit button is. I bring 110% of my energy and focus to my work everyday and if that sounds up your alley, feel free to reach out. Let's chat! </p>
