  				<h2>Hello.</h2>
  				<p>I'm someone who would go to school forever if not for the crippling weight of student loans. As it is, the internet is a great plan B. I got into design and development as a way to bring my creations to life, and so far, none of them have tried to attack the nearest village. I count that as a win. </p>
  				<p>I'm passionate about creating things that make people pause and go "Wow", or "THAT'S COOL". It's mostly because that's how I got into all this <i>*gestures to the air*</i> in the first place and I want other people to find the same joy for themselves.</p>
  				<p>Feel free to reach out to me with comments, questions, concerns, or bitcoin.</p>
