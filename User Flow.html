		<p>Transitioning to a new team can always be a challenging time but transitioning to a whole new field and vocabulary that has literally hundreds of acronyms is quite the feat. When I joined the mortgage team earlier this year, I had to very quickly and succinctly figure out a way to understand our user base and what their needs were so that I could begin creating intuitive and useful experiences for them as quickly as possible. I felt that jumping straight into designing solutions for a user base I knew nothing about would be the quickest way to creating terrible experiences.

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>The first thing I had to do was to talk with everyone on my team to understand who it was, exactly, that we were creating experiences for. After talking with them, I was able to gather a list of not one, not two, not even three, but eight different user groups that used our product on a daily basis, all of whom used very different and distinct areas of the application. After looking at my long list, I decided that what I needed to do was understand the 3-4 important “jobs to be done” that each user group would care about the most, so that going forward I could try to research those flows to see where I could make improvements.	
        </p>
        <p>To find out the jobs to be done, I recruited some of our sales team and project managers to sit down with me over the course of 4 days and go through every area of the application that could possibly be touched by each of our user groups, and to bucket their tasks into jobs and flows, according to the area of the product they were in. </p>
        <p>The final product was a Freehand from InVision that not only listed out each user groups job to be done, but also broke it down into areas of the application the user was in to complete their task, as well as how each of their steps might relate to the next group’s flow. It was definitely a time-consuming task, but at the end of it, I was able to take the flows I had put together and apply them to some new user interview tests that I put together to find out where user pain points might be in the product. Understanding how their tasks related to a different user group also helped me contextualize their feedback, which has been incredibly useful.</p>
