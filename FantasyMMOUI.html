		<p>As a fun personal project, I decided to tackle a high fantasy MMO game inventory. I wireframed, prototyped, and have been implementing the UI in Unreal Engine 5 through the use of MVVM and UMG. I chose inventory management because in MMOs, it can be one of the hardest user experiences to design. It needs to flow easily while also showing the user everything they have access to. It also needs to be flexible enough for the game team to add and take away things they need, like rarity, gems, etc. Depending on if you are designing for console or not, you also need to consider things like how to open sublists or make category structures that can be easily accessed with a controller vs a mouse. A lot of times design will use a virtual mouse when switching to console, but you still have to consider how tricky your hit targets might be for something with less control than a PC mouse.

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>My first research question was how to layout the inventory? For a fantasy game, especially an MMO, you're going to have a LOT of different crafting items, weapons, resources, potions, etc in your inventory. There are a few examples of how we could approach this problem:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>• A la BotW, with simpler tab categories</li>
			<li>• A la new world, with weights and items broken down into really small categories </li>
			<li>• Something in between </li>
			</ul>	
		</p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>	
		<p>While wireframing, I ended up going back and doing more research on the open world games that I thought had minimal user interfaces. I also tried to keep my scope limited to just the initial user start up, since I was on a tight time schedule. I felt that focusing on this area would help me later down the road since many of the screens and UI components from an initial user onboarding can be reused in other screens.</p>

		<h2>3D Modeling</h2>
		<p>Because I had never tried my hand at 3D modeling before, I was really excited to give it a go. I decided that I would spend the bulk of my time learning how to do basic character modeling and lighting/rendering, since those would build a good knowledge base for me in the future if I went back to visit this game idea. For the office itself, I knew that it would take more time than I had to create all the assets I would need, so I found and downloaded a wonderful office model from lowpolyside on CGTrader.</p>

		<h2>UI High Fidelity</h2>
		<p>After settling on the final wireframes and picking two screens to do high fidelity renders on, I imported them into Photoshop and got to work. I started with the much more complicated play screen first, since it would help me work on a broader range of UI components that could be reused on the character creation screen. </p>
		<p>Because my game was low-poly, I looked up examples of low-poly user interfaces and tried to mimic the style as best I could. I had a few moments where I had to start over because my UI was looking too flat, but in the end I’m happy with the designs. I also added a bit of “weathering” to my UI components, and that seemed to make them stand out a bit more from the screen.</p>

		<h2>After Thoughts</h2>
		<p>While this was a great exercise in game design, there are definitely a few improvements I would like to make. </p>
		<p>On the character creation screen, I realized that my 3D character currently only accommodates people with large chest areas and doesn’t allow for customization in that area. Instead of adding the typical “male” “female” option, I think I would like to somehow make a slider to adjust the chest size to make a more inclusive option for players who maybe identify as female but don’t necessarily want to be represented that way by a large chest; I also want people who identify as neither to not have to choose a gender. However, a slidable chest area might make the lives of my developers a bit more complicated, so we would have to talk that one through 😅.</p>
		<p>Another area that I would have liked to explore is accessory options. This could be a unique way to identify the player if the game ever expanded into a co-op situation. Since low-poly games don’t often come with a large number of distinguishing characteristics, accessories like a blue hat or a green dragon scale backpack could be fun ways to individualize a character.</p>
		<p>On the play screen itself, I think the XP bar could use a few more iterations. While I explored a lot of options in the wireframing stage for the quest log, map, player item areas, I didn’t do much exploration of the XP bar. A few questions I have about it as it stands: Does the XP counter within the bar give the user any additional information that the bar itself could not provide? Do we need it? Also, is the player’s level in an area that is visible enough that they don’t have to go searching for it? And lastly, though it matches the style of the rest of the UI elements, does it detract from the rest of the play experience by being so large at the top of the screen? Or would players rather see a smaller XP bar somewhere else, like in other open world games (ie: WoW and Genshin Impact).</p>
		<p>Lastly, I’m not sure if the “weathering” that I added to my UI elements really fits with the low-poly corporate theme of the game. While it might be more applicable for a world builder game or maybe a map conquest game, the weathered look of craggy buttons and boxes might distract the player by looking out of place.</p>
		<p>All in all, this was a heckin’ lot of fun, and what started as a small exercise might actually turn into a really fun side project for me this year.</p>
